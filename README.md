# React Typescript Template

This project serves as a template for any `create-react-app`s using Typescript. After copying to a directory, and setting it up, you can run the app which will show some large text as "Hello World!"

## Setup

Firstly, if you copied this project over to a new directory, make sure to remove the `.git` folder since this should be used on a brand-new project.

This project uses `yarn` so run:

```
yarn install
```

To run the app, `foreman` is set up to run the React script and the `sass` watcher.

To run these, type:

```
nf start
```
